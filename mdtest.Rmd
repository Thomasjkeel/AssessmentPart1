This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}

library(geojsonio)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
#read some data attributes
LondonData <- read_csv("https://files.datapress.com/london/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas/2015-09-24T14:21:24/ward-profiles-excel-version.csv", na = "n/a")
#read some geometries

#pull out London

#convert to a simple features object

#append the data to the geometries
